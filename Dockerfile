# TIP - use SHA with non-semantic versions
#   dependabot expects dot-delimited version numbers (for example, https://semver.org/)
#   Node has a concept of long-term support releases. However, you don't want a tag that can update outside of a code change.
#   In these cases, you can use a generic tag (lts) and pin it to a specific SHA, and dependabot will update that instead.
